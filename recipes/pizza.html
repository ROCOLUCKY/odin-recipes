    <h2><strong>Ingredients for Pizza Dough:</strong></h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 1/4 teaspoons active dry yeast (1 packet)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup warm water (about 110°F)</li>
        <li>2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h2><strong>Ingredients for Pizza Sauce:</strong></h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 can (15 oz) crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons dried oregano</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons dried basil</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sugar (optional, to taste)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2><strong>Instructions for Pizza Dough:</strong></h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a small bowl, dissolve yeast and sugar in warm water. Let sit until frothy, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine flour, salt, olive oil, and the yeast mixture. Stir until the dough comes together.</li>
        <li>Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about 7-10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Place the dough in a well-oiled bowl, cover with a damp cloth, and let rise in a warm place until doubled in size, about 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Once risen, punch down the dough and form it into a ball. Let it rest for a few minutes before stretching it out into a pizza shape.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2><strong>Instructions for Pizza Sauce:</strong></h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Add minced garlic and sauté until fragrant, about 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Add crushed tomatoes, oregano, basil, salt, pepper, and sugar if using. Simmer for about 20-30 minutes until the sauce thickens slightly.</li>
        <li>Adjust seasoning to taste.</li>
    </ol>

    <p><strong>Assembly and Baking:</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to the highest setting, typically between 450°F to 500°F (230°C to 260°C).</li>
        <li>Stretch the dough on a pizza stone or a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Spread the sauce over the dough, add your choice of toppings, and sprinkle with cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for about 10-15 minutes or until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbly.</li>
        <li>Remove from oven, let cool slightly, and serve.</li>
    </ol>
