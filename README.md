ODIN PROJECT RECIPE
# Odin Recipes

## Project Overview
This project is part of my learning journey through The Odin Project's foundations course. The website is a simple HTML project that includes a main page and three separate recipe pages. Each page details one of my favorite dishes.

## Structure

### Index Page
- **Filename**: `index.html`
- Contains a main heading "Odin Recipes" and links to three recipe pages.

### Recipe Pages
Each recipe page is located within the `recipes` directory and includes the following sections:
- An image of the finished dish.
- A description of the dish.
- A list of ingredients required for making the dish.
- Step-by-step instructions on how to prepare the dish.

#### Recipes Included:
1. **Lasagne al Forno**
   - **File**: `lasagna.html`
2. **Buttery Lemon Chicken**
   - **File**: `Lemonchicken.html`
3. **Pizza (Dough and Sauce)**
   - **File**: `pizza.html`

## Navigation

Links to all recipe pages are included on the index page under an unordered list, making it easy to navigate between the different recipes.

## Development

This project was created using basic HTML and follows the structure provided by The Odin Project's curriculum. Each recipe page is structured with semantic HTML elements to ensure readability and accessibility.

## Viewing the Project

To view the project, open the `index.html` file in any web browser. From there, you can navigate to any of the recipe pages by clicking on the links provided under the "Odin Recipes" heading.

## Future Improvements

Future improvements might include adding CSS for styling, incorporating JavaScript for interactive elements, or expanding the recipe list to include more of my favorite dishes.
